    <p>I have completed BTech in Mechanical Engineering from MG University. After my college, I have worked as Project Sales Engineer in AL Rams Group, Dubai for 2 years. Later I realized that my future would not be same as the one which I have been dreaming, if I stay in this field. So I decided to change my field of job to the one which is most suitable for me,i.e. developing field. Now I am trying my level best to get an opportunity to be a part of one of the best MNCs.</p>
